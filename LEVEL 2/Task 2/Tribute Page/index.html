          <cite>Steve Jobs is dead, but his legacy will live on for decades to come. It is impossible to overstate the impact his work had not only on the world of technology, but on the world as a whole. Here are the top 5 ways Jobs changed society.</cite>
        </p>
        <hr>
        <h2 class="text-center">5. He made PCs before they were PCs.</h2>
        <p class="text-center">Today, the term PC refers to computers that run on Intel processors and use Windows software -- in other words, pretty much every computer that isn't a Mac. But when the term was first coined, it simply stood for personal computer. The first Mac computers were known as PCs, because they were computers designed to be used by individuals -- and the Apple II series, designed by Steve Jobs and Apple co-founder Steve Wozniak, was in fact the first widely successful PC. Today's computers may be classified as PC or Mac, but they all evolved from the original PC prototype -- and we have Steve Jobs to thank for that.</p>
        <hr>
        <h2 class="text-center">4. He made computers simple.</h2>
        <p class="text-center">In the 1990s, Apple computers were held largely in disdain. The interface was too plain, too spare. It couldn't be customized. They couldn't compare to the computers Microsoft was making. But as the years went by, Steve Jobs began to win people over to his vision of a computer that was powerful but also intuitive, easy to use and highly functional. Apple's advertising mantra became, It just works. And it did. Users began to abandon PCs for Macs in droves as they realized that Macs froze less, glitched less, crashed less and were easier to navigate besides.</p>
        <hr>
        <h2 class="text-center">3. He made advertising innovative.</h2>
        <p class="text-center">Apple began to push the advertising envelope as early as 1984, in a famous commercial that ran during the Super Bowl: an athlete runs into a room straight out of a dystopian novel and throws a sledgehammer at a projector screen full of propaganda, and then the screen reads, On January 24, Apple Computer will introduce Macintosh. And you'll see why 1984 won't be like '1984.' More recently, there was the 66-installment Get a Mac ad campaign featuring John Hodgman as a stodgy, outdated PC and Justin Long as a sophisticated Mac. And, of course, there were the ads for the iPod and iTunes, with colors as bright and eye-catching as those on the original iMacs and theme songs from bands like U2, Coldplay and the Gorillaz.</p>
        <hr>
        <h2 class="text-center">2. He turned technology into art.</h2>
        <p class="text-center">Dell was right up there with Microsoft at the forefront of the tech world in the 1990s -- but Steve Jobs wasn't impressed. He once famously dismissed Dell's computers as un-innovative beige boxes, and went on to envision and execute a stream of products that combined power and functionality with pure elegance. In 1998, the iMac took everyone aback with its brightly colored sides, and a year later, users were delighted with the iBook's unique clamshell design. Since then, Jobs never stopped coming up with new products that were as aesthetically pleasing as they were technologically advanced. Never before had design been as important as hardware and engineering, but that is today's norm. Apple products are revered not just because they are powerful and work well, but because they look and feel good.</p>
        <hr>
        <h2 class="text-center">1. He connected every aspect of our lives.</h2>
        <p class="text-center">House Majority Leader Eric Cantor paid tribute to Steve Jobs with a statement both simple and profound: There is not a day that goes by, and often not an hour, that a Steve Jobs invention does not better my family's life. Before Jobs came along, no one had thought to integrate so many things -- computers, music players, phones -- into the same company. Jobs shattered the boundaries of what a computer company should do, turning Apple into a huge network of products that touched nearly every aspect of daily life. For everything we do, it seems, there's an app for that. We work and spend our free time on MacBook Pros and iPads, listen to our iTunes libraries on our iPods, talk and text and play games on our iPhones, edit photos and videos in iPhoto and iMovie. The Apple software suite is called iLife, and it is not much of an exaggeration.</p>

        <p class="text-center">As Bill Gates shaped the experience of using the personal computer that sat on our desks, so Steve Jobs fashioned the experience of using the one we now carry around. Gates redefined the way millions of people work. Jobs redefined the style in which they live and set a new expectation about the embedding of technology in daily life.</p>
        <p class="text-center">His creative genius revolutionized not just his industry and its products, but also everything from music and movies to smartphones. He provided a platform for others to create and distribute apps, bringing innovation and change to an even wider sphere. Apple's co-founder tops our anniversary list of the 25 most transformative leaders, icons and rebels of the past-quarter century. More than any other member of our group of extraordinary entrepreneurs and executives—all outstanding leaders—his vision spurred changes far beyond his industry and put an indelible stamp on the wider culture.</p>

        <h3 class="text-center">Steve Jobs seized his chance to change the world</h3>
        <hr>
        <p class="text-center">Steve Jobs unleashed a frenzy of innovative products during his second spell at Apple that transformed not just the PC, but everything from music to smartphones.</p>
        <p class="text-center">In 1977, Jobs and his friend, Steve Wozniak, both early microcomputer enthusiasts, launched the Apple II with its innovative color graphics, full qwerty keyboard and internal slots for expansion.</p>
        <p class="text-center">Wozniak was the technician and Jobs, who didn't code, became the salesman. But in the early 1980s Jobs spotted something no one else saw: the commercial potential for a mouse-driven graphical interface developed at Xerox PARC's research labs. It appeared on the Apple Lisa and, a year later, the first Macintosh, and was a vital part of what put Apple on a distinctly different road from other computer makers.</p>

        <h3 class="text-center">25 years later: The dramatic change in gadgets</h3>
        <hr>
        <p class="text-center">It was not a successful path initially. Apple's machines cost more than other PCs, used their own operating system instead of Microsoft's increasingly dominant MS-DOS and had fewer software applications written for them. Sales sagged. In 1983, Jobs enticed John Sculley from Pepsi to address the problems as Apple's CEO. But they clashed, and two years later Jobs was forced out of the company he had founded. He started NeXT, which built high-end computer workstations, and in 1986 bought Lucasfilm's computer graphics division, Pixar. He ran it until 2006, when the Walt Disney Co. bought it for $7.4 billion, making Jobs Disney's biggest shareholder.</p>
        <p class="text-center">In 1997, with Apple again flailing—this time over upgrading its OS—and on the verge of bankruptcy, CEO Gil Amelio turned to Jobs and the object-oriented OS he had developed at NeXT. Jobs came back to Apple to advise on the Mac OS X. Amelio left shortly after, and Jobs resumed the CEO post. He restored Apple to profitability in 1998.</p>

        <h3 class="text-center">How does touchscreen technology work?</h3>
        <hr>
        <p class="text-center">The second coming of Jobs as CEO brought the iMac, iTunes, the iPod, the iPhone and the iPad, as well as Apple retail stores, the iTunes store and its Apps store, each a connected facet of the future he had envisioned.</p>
        <p class="text-center">Jobs died in 2011 at the age of 56 after an eight-year battle with pancreatic cancer. His stunning series of inventions had changed the way people use technology to connect and communicate, and had made Apple the world's most valuable public company. Jobs left his widow, Laurene, a fortune that Bloomberg estimates at $13 billion.</p>
        <p class="text-center">Jobs was a charismatic and seductive leader, and often an arbitrary and impatient manager. His design guru, Jony Ive, has said that he never bothered to unpack when traveling with his boss because Jobs always found the hotel unacceptable. He was a perfectionist, equally obsessive about product quality and design, and fiercely protective of the Apple brand.</p>

        <h3 class="text-center">Beyond Steve Jobs: Tech's game-changers</h3>
        <hr>
        <p class="text-center">For all his driving desire to make the impossible possible and have Apple imagine the future first, Jobs never ignored the business imperative of making and delivering products.</p>
        <p class="text-center">"Real artists ship," he said. But his legacy is a rhetorical answer to the question Jobs asked Sculley when talking him into joining Apple: "Do you want to spend the rest of your life selling sugared water, or do you want a chance to change the world?"</p>
